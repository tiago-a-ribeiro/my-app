        <p>Talk about we used Bulma and fontawesome and how using css libraries is not only a great way to make websites look good but also speed up that process of styling websites</p>
        <p>
          One of the best ways to make a website look great is by making use of a CSS library. The most popular CSS library is Bootstrap but for this website we decided
          to make use of a different, pure CSS libary called BULMA.
